# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the complete workflow of an end-to-end machine learning project, encompassing data ingestion, transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The project also includes setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and deployment on AWS.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Ingestion**: Scripts and documentation related to data collection or generation.
- **Data Transformation**: Code for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Model Trainer**: Scripts to train the machine learning model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Code to evaluate the model performance using various metrics.
- **Model Deployment**: Instructions and scripts for deploying the model into a production environment.

### CI/CD Pipelines

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring our codebase is robust and deployable at any moment.

### Deployment

The model is deployed to AWS, utilizing services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and Amazon EC2 to host and serve the model predictions.
